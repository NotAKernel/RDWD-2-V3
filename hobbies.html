				<h3>Reading & Writing</h3>
				<p>
					I quite enjoy writing in general - sometimes it is poetry and other times, more often than the former,
					it is prose. I have been writing ever since I can remember, and I still have a few of those
					stories lying around here and there. It is a dream of mine to get a book published, and possibly
					have that book become well-known; I have been working towards this dream for a few years
					now, thought it must be said with no lack of redrafts and complete scraps.
				</p>
				<p>
					Naturally, I like to read. As of writing this, I am almost the whole way through the complete
					Sherlock Holmes collection, which I have read parts of now and again but finally decided to
					read the stories in their entirety. Reading is also one of the earliest memories of mine, and
					I started with some girly teenage books on my sister's shelf. Since then, I've transitioned
					more into reading classics - still, I have those first books to thank for inspiring my love
					of reading, which in turn inspires me when I write. I suppose the title of 'favourite' will
					have to go to <i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i> by Alexandre Dumas; it is an excellent mesh
					of interwoven tales and backstories, with the best undertones of revenge that I have yet
					experienced. My utmost recommendation goes without saying.
				</p>

				<h3>Listening and Playing</h3>
				<p>
					I listen to music practically everyday, mostly when I'm doing some kind of work or simply to
					relax (right now I'm listening to <i>Days of Future Passed</i> by The Moody Blues). Not much
					to be said about this one, as I think everyone understands why music is universally cherished,
					even those peculiar ones that don't enjoy it. The main bands I listen to are anywhere from the
					60s to the 80s, with a few modern ones too. Electric Light Orchestra first introduced me to
					listening to full albums and hearing the different sounds of an artist/band as they progress.
					For that reason, they'll always be my number one band, but bands like Supertramp, The Alan
					Parson Project and The Moody Blues aren't far behind.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The instruments I play are piano and guitar, though I've been playing piano for a lot longer -
					somewhere around ten years or so. My mother teaches piano, so that isn't so surprising. I mostly
					taught myself, and so the theory side of things has suffered a bit and I pick pieces up faster
					by ear than by sight-reading. It's a great thing to be able to play an instrument - a form of
					therapy, I find.

				<h3>Board Games to Video Games</h3>
				<p>
					Arguably, one of my favourite ways to pass time. It's much more fun with friends, but most
					of these can also be played alone if there's no one around. I quite enjoy playing chess and
					learning different openings, but I also like to solve chess puzzles and see a powerful position
					or trade unravel itself on the board.
				</p>
				<p>
					As for video games, I've played a lot. Most of the time I spend playing games is with friends,
					however a good single-player game with a compelling story and good mechanics is right up my
					alley. One I'm playing at the moment is Dead Cells, which is a roguelite. At first glance, doing
					the same thing over and over again in different ways may seem a quick way to get bored, but the
					gameplay mechanics are what keep me playing it. The art style is pretty good, too.
